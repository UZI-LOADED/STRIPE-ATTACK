6. 📡 Webhook Spoof / Injection
Target: Merchant that trusts incoming Stripe webhooks too easily
Weapon: Fake webhook with a refund or charge event
Method:


POST /webhook HTTP/1.1
Host: victim.com
Stripe-Signature: [forged]
{ "type": "charge.succeeded", ... }


💀 System believes event is real and acts on it (gives goods, access, etc.)

🛡️ Fix:

Always verify signature

Never trust incoming webhook blindly

Use Stripe’s SDK verification methods
